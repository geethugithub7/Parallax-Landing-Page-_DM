# Parallax-Landing-Page-_DM
This project is a simple landing page demonstrating the parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. The landing page contains multiple sections, each with a background image that moves at a different speed compared to the foreground content. The project was built after attending a class on the DebugMedia YouTube channel.
