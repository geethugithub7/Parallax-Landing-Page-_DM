# Parallex Effect Landing Page

This project is a parallax scrolling effect landing page built using HTML and CSS. It was created after attending a tutorial from DebugMedia on YouTube. The page is simple and showcases the use of the `background-attachment: fixed` CSS property to achieve the parallax effect.

## Features

- **Parallax scrolling effect**: Background images scroll at different speeds relative to the foreground content.
- **Responsive design**: The page is fully responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
- **Smooth transitions**: The navigation links have smooth color transitions on hover.
  
## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling and implementing the parallax effect.
